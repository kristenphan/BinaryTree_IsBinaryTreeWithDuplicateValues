# this program reads the input, a valid binary tree,

# if yes, output 'CORRECT'. otherwise, output 'INCORRECT'
# definition of a BST tree with possibly duplicate keys:
# --- for any node of the tree, if its key is ùë•, then for any node in its left subtree,
# --- its key must be strictly less than ùë•,
# --- and for any node in its right subtree,
# --- its key must be greater than or equal to ùë•.
# --- In other words, smaller elements are to the left, bigger elements are to the right,
# --- and duplicates are always to the right.
# the program uses IsBinarySearchTree() to determine if a tree is a BST. See comments in IsBinarySearchTree() to see how this algorithm works
